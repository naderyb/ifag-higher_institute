## 🔧 Install & Run (for frontend)

# Clone the repo

## 🧠 Developer Notes

- **Routing**: Handled via `vue-router` — all views are located in `src/views`
- **SEO**: Meta tags are configured in `public/index.html` for better visibility across platforms (Google, Twitter, Facebook, etc.)
- **Responsive Layout**: Fully Bootstrap-powered grid + utility classes
- **Component-based**: Navbar, Footer, FAQ, Cards, etc., are modular and reusable

---

## 🧪 Ready for Backend Integration

The frontend is **API-ready** — dynamic sections (formations, alumni, blog, etc.) are designed to plug into your backend endpoints easily.

- Use `fetch()` or Axios to load backend data into each section
- Components are ready to accept props or `v-for` loops from backend responses

📎 **Example endpoint ideas** (for backend devs):

| Section       | Suggested Endpoint      |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Formations    | `GET /api/formations`   |
| Alumni        | `GET /api/alumni`       |
| Blog Posts    | `GET /api/posts`        |
| Contact Form  | `POST /api/contact`     |
---

## 🛠 Customization

Want to tweak something?

- Update `App.vue` for layout-wide changes
- Modify individual pages inside `src/views/`
- Add new routes in `src/router/index.js`
- Change styles or colors in scoped `<style>` blocks or Bootstrap utility classes
